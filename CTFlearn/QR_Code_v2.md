How well are you in the ways of the QR Code? https://mega.nz/#!JItR3aqI!QKGxexShAPt-HUU_2DAdJKUljXc69sx1fXuaGUeoKaY

#### SOLUTION:

So, here we have a challenge where we are given a QR code if we download this image in the link given.<br><br>
First thing comes in our mind solving this challenge is scanning this QR code.<br>
So, we scan it using an online tool. We can use any online QR Code scanner, I prefer using : **https://pageloot.com/qr-code-scanner/#upload**.<br>
So, here we can upload the image downloaded and when we click scan, we get what it contains: Its type, content are the main parts we need to focus on.<br><br>

  </p>
<br><br>

So , now we can see we have got an URL in the result and a link to it.<br>
Fortunately, when we open that link, we are redirected to a site contianing **flag.txt**.<br>
And yes, when we open this file, we get our flag as CTF{2_QR_4_U}.

**FLAG: CTF{2_QR_4_U}**
