In the computing industry, standards are established to facilitate information interchanges among American coders.
Unfortunately, I've made communication a little bit more difficult. Can you figure this one out?

#### SOLUTION<br><br>

So, here we have an easy challenge where we are given a string of mixed number and characters<br>
By reading the challenge, we can know they are talking about ASCII which is abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.<br>
So, we now know we have ASCII characters and we just need to convert it to plain text to get our flag.<br><br>
For this, we can use any ASCII decoder online, I prefer using : http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/ascii/ which will easily convert ASCII chars into text.<br>
